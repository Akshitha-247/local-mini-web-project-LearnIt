🌟 What is LearnIt?
LearnIt is a conceptual mini web platform designed to serve as a learning hub for coding tutorials and projects. It acts like a personal or educational site that offers visitors a place to explore tutorials, get project ideas, and contact the creators.

🔧 What Does It Contain?
1. Navigation Bar
Buttons: Home, Tutorials, Projects, About Us, and Contact

Clicking each button dynamically opens a small HTML page in a new tab using JavaScript (not actual routing or navigation).

2. Homepage Banner
Title: "Welcome to LearnIt!"

Subtitle: “Your one-stop platform for tutorials and projects in coding and development.”

A search bar for finding specific tutorials or projects.

3. Featured Tutorials
A section showing clickable tutorials:

Python Basics for Beginners

Building Web Apps with Flask

Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Clicking on any tutorial opens a new tab with a dummy detailed page for that tutorial.

4. Call-To-Action Buttons
Start Learning → Takes you to the tutorials section.

Browse Projects → Takes you to the projects section.

5. Contact Page
Email and phone info

A contact form with name, email, and message inputs

On submission, it shows an alert message like “Thanks for reaching out!”

6. Search Functionality
You can type in the search bar (e.g., “python” or “todo”) and it will open a new page listing matching tutorials or projects.

It's a simple keyword match (case-insensitive).

💡 What's the Use of This Project?
✅ Learning Purposes
Teaches basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Shows how to use Python’s http.server to run a static site locally.

✅ Prototype for Portfolio
Can be used as a base for your portfolio website.

You can replace dummy text with real projects and links.

✅ Expandable
Could be extended into a real web app using Flask, Django, or React.

Can be hosted on GitHub Pages as a static site.

🧠 Summary in Simple Terms:
LearnIt is like a demo website that shows what a coding tutorials platform would look like. It has fake content for now, but it gives you a real working structure to learn how websites behave.
